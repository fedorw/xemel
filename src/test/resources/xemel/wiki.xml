'''James Elisha Folsom, Sr.''' (October 9, 1908 &amp;ndash; November 21, 1987), commonly known as '''Jim Folsom''' or '''Big Jim Folsom''', was the [[List of Governors of Alabama|42nd]] [[Governor of Alabama|governor]] of the [[U.S. state]] of [[Alabama]], having served from 1947 to 1951, and again from 1955 to 1959.

==Background==
Born in [[Coffee County, Alabama|Coffee County]] in southeastern Alabama, Folsom was among the first [[Southern United States|southern]] governors to embrace [[Racial integration|integration]] and enforcement of [[civil rights]] for [[African American]]s. In his [[Christmas]] message on December 25, 1949, he said: &quot;As long as the Negroes are held down by deprivation and lack of opportunity, the other poor people will be held down alongside them&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Jet (magazine)|Jet]]'', January 2, 1958 issue&lt;/ref&gt;

After service in the [[United States Merchant Marine]] in the early 1930s, Folsom became an insurance salesman. He attended the [[University of Alabama]] at [[Tuscaloosa, Alabama|Tuscaloosa]], [[Samford University]] in [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]], and [[George Washington University]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]; however, he never obtained a college degree.

Before his gubernatorial campaigns, he won a race only once: as delegate to the [[1944 Democratic National Convention]]. He was a strong supporter of keeping [[VPOTUS|Vice President]] [[Henry A. Wallace]] on the [[ticket (politics)|ticket]], rather than replacing him with [[Harry S. Truman]] of [[Missouri]], as it so developed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,792939,00.html], ''Time'' magazine&lt;/ref&gt;

==Folsom as governor==

Folsom was elected governor for the first time in 1946. He waged a colorful campaign with a [[hillbilly]] band, brandishing a mop and bucket that he said would &quot;clean out&quot; the [[Alabama State Capitol|Capitol]]. 

On March 3, 1948, Folsom's name was in headlines across the nation when 30-year-old Christine Johnston, a widow who had met Folsom in late 1944 while she was working as a cashier at the Tutwiler Hotel in Birmingham, filed a paternity suit against the Governor, alleging that he was the father of her 22-month-old son.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Unwed Mother Sues Gov. Folsom of Alabama; Tells Affair|url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1948/03/03/page/1|accessdate=14 November 2014|work=Chicago Daily Tribune|date=March 3, 1948}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Undaunted, nine days after the suit was filed Folsom appeared on the sidewalk in front of the Barbizon Modeling School in New York City, where he kissed a hundred pretty models who had voted him &quot;The Nation's Number One Leap Year Bachelor,&quot; attracting a crowd of 2500 onlookers and causing a traffic jam.  Johnston dropped the suit in June for a cash settlement from Folsom, who years later admitted to an interviewer that he was indeed the father of Johnston's child.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Grafton|first1=Carl|last2=Permaloff|first2=Anne|title=Big Mules and Branchheads: James E. Folsom and Political Power in Alabama|date=1985|publisher=University of Georgia Press|location=Athens, Georgia|isbn=0820331880|pages=113-114|edition=Paperback, 2008|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=KFFySG4iLKEC&amp;dq=%22jim+folsom%22+paternity+suit&amp;q=christine+johnston#v=snippet&amp;q=christine%20johnston&amp;f=false|accessdate=14 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 5, 1948, without prior publicity, Folsom married 20-year-old [[Jamelle Folsom|Jamelle Moore]], a secretary at the state Highway Department, whom he had met during his 1946 campaign and had been dating and seeing &quot;almost daily&quot; since then.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hammond|first1=Ralph|title=Jim and Jamelle - a Love Story|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1891&amp;dat=19550118&amp;id=hhUpAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=bNcEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1038,1682776|accessdate=14 November 2014|work=The Gadsden Times|issue=Inaugural Edition|date=January 18, 1955}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, despite the paternity suit and other [[scandal]]s that arose during his administration, he was easily elected to a second non-consecutive term in 1954. The [[Alabama Constitution]] at that time forbade a governor from succeeding himself, then a common provision in most southern states. Folsom was 6'8&quot; and employed the slogan &quot;the little man's big friend.&quot;

In 1958, Governor Folsom commuted a death sentence imposed on [[Jimmy Wilson (handyman)|James E. Wilson]], an African American sentenced to death for a $1.95 robbery. The Wilson case sparked international protests, but some segregationists called for Folsom not to commute the sentence.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Jet (magazine)|Jet]]'', October 9, 1958 issue&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, Folsom did not intervene in another controversial case, that of [[Jeremiah Reeves]], who was [[electric chair|electrocuted]] the same year, also sparking protests.&lt;ref&gt;Virginia Foster Durr, Patricia Sullivan, ''Freedom Writer: Virginia Foster Durr, Letters from the Civil Rights Years'', Routledge, 2003, ISBN 0-415-94516-X, 9780415945165&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Jet (magazine)|Jet]]''. April 10, 1958 issue&lt;/ref&gt;

==Two unsuccessful races==

In 1962, Folsom again ran for governor against his one-time protégé [[George Wallace|George C. Wallace]], but he was defeated. A sardonic slogan emerged during that campaign, referring to Folsom's reputation for taking graft: &quot;Something for everyone and a little bit for Big Jim.&quot; Folsom sometimes referred to &quot;the emoluments of office&quot; and once told a campaign crowd, &quot;I plead guilty to stealing. That crowd I got it from, you had to steal it to get it.... I stole for you, and you, and you.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://books.google.com/books?id=KFFySG4iLKEC&amp;pg=PA170&amp;lpg=PA170&amp;dq=folsom+%2B+%22That+crowd+I+got+it+from,+you+had+to+steal+it+to%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=B4C82duyoQ&amp;sig=0QQ8nAqgHWIl9NSgCLxSQIY6zxM&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=sfqPTPG_HcWBlAeHqLzTAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=folsom%20%2B%20%22That%20crowd%20I%20got%20it%20from%2C%20you%20had%20to%20steal%20it%20to%22&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

Folsom's campaign was also damaged by a [[television]] appearance where he appeared to have been seriously intoxicated and unable to remember his own children's names.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/7624706/George-Wallace.html&lt;/ref&gt; Both the appearance and the supposed &quot;slogan&quot; hurt him with the image-conscious middle class. 

Folsom ran again for governor in 1966, when he faced three other leading Democrats in the primary, former [[U.S. Representative]] [[Carl Elliott]], former Governor [[John Malcolm Patterson]], and [[Attorney General of Alabama|Attorney General]] [[Richmond Flowers, Sr.]] However, the primary winner was none of those candidates but the surrogate for outgoing Governor George Wallace, his first wife [[Lurleen Burns Wallace]]. In the general election Lurleen Wallace handily defeated the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] nominee, [[James D. Martin]], a one-term U.S. representative from [[Gadsden, Alabama|Gadsden]].&lt;ref&gt;Billy Hathorn, &quot;A Dozen Years in the Political Wilderness: The Alabama Republican Party, 1966-1978&quot;, ''Gulf Coast Historical Review'', Vol. 9, No. 2 (Spring 1994), p. 22, 28&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Folsom never again was elected to public office.

==Later years==

Folsom died in 1987 in [[Cullman, Alabama|Cullman]]. His niece, [[Cornelia Wallace]], the daughter of his sister, Ruby Folsom Ellis, was from 1971 to 1978 the second wife of his former rival, George Wallace.

A documentary film about Folsom entitled [http://www.waterfrontpix.com/bigjimfolsom.htm ''Big Jim Folsom:  The Two Faces of Populism'']  was produced in 1996 by Alabama filmmaker [[Robert Clem]], and won the 1997 International Documentary Association/ABCNews VideoSource Award and the Southeastern Filmmaker Award at the 1997 Atlanta Film Festival.

In the 1997 [[TNT (TV channel)|TNT]] film ''George Wallace'', directed by John Frankenheimer, Jim Folsom is played by [[Joe Don Baker]], who was nominated for a CableACE award for his performance. [[Gary Sinise]] played Wallace.

Folsom's son [[Jim Folsom, Jr.|James E. Folsom, Jr.]] (dubbed &quot;Little Jim&quot; though he is physically large but because of his father's nickname) is also a noted Alabama politician. He served as Alabama [[Lieutenant Governor of Alabama|lieutenant governor]] from 1986 to 1993. He assumed the office of governor when Republican Governor [[Guy Hunt]] was removed from office after having been convicted of state ethics law violations. Folsom, Jr., ran for governor in 1994 but was defeated by Republican former Governor [[Fob James]]. He decided to re-enter state politics in 2006, qualifying for and eventually winning the lieutenant governor's position once again, having served from 2007 to 2011.

Jim Folsom, Sr., had nine children, two by his first wife, Sarah, and seven by his second wife, Jamelle Folsom. Folsom's first wife, the former Sarah Carnley, died in 1944 due to pregnancy complications.&lt;ref name=ctimes1&gt;{{cite news|first=Benjamin|last=Bullard|title=Former first lady Jamelle Folsom remembered (Updated with 2004 Times interview) |url=http://www.cullmantimes.com/local/x1752040672/Former-first-lady-Jamelle-Folsom-remembered |work=[[Cullman Times]] |publisher= |date=2012-11-30 |accessdate=2012-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ma&gt;{{cite news|first=|last=|title=Former Ala. first lady Jamelle Folsom dies at 85 |url=http://www.montgomeryadvertiser.com/viewart/20121202/NEWS02/312020015/Former-Ala-first-lady-Jamelle-Folsom-dies-85 |work=[[Associated Press]] |publisher=[[Montgomery Advertiser]] |date=2012-12-02 |accessdate=2012-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Folsom eloped and married his second wife, former [[First Lady]] of Alabama [[Jamelle Folsom]], in 1948.&lt;ref name=ma/&gt; They remained married until his death.&lt;ref name=ma/&gt;
